            <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium text-primary mb-8">My journey</h2>
            
            <div className="space-y-6 text-primary/70">
              <p>
                My journey began in the cockpit of a Navy helicopter. I spent my twenties in high-stakes situations‚Äîmaking split-second decisions, finding order amidst complexity, and building detected by hard work, performance, and resilience. But six months into my first squadron tour, a helicopter crash landing to the aft end of an aircraft carrier changed everything.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I walked away physically intact‚Äîbut <strong>mentally and emotionally</strong>, something cracked open.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                That moment planted a seed: <em>"Life is fragile, and time is irreplaceable."</em><br />
                I started to ask questions I had long avoided.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                What's the point of building wealth if you're not present for your life?<br />
                What are we working so hard to get <strong>not to live well now</strong>?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                That curiosity sent me down an unexpected path.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I explored environmental science, soil health, medicine, and eventually <strong>financial planning</strong>‚Äînot as a career, but as a way to understand how people make choices.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I saw how easy it is to drift through life‚Äîeven with a good paycheck and a solid resume‚Äîand still feel purposeless, or behind.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Eventually, I realized that the world doesn't need more traditional advisors.<br />
                It needs guides‚Äîpeople who bridge the gap between money and meaning.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                So I started <strong>Outlive Financial Planning</strong>. A firm grounded in two simple truths:
